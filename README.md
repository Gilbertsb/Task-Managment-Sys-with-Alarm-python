# Tasks management system with Alarm

Assignment 10
what we were working on is making sure that our system is able to handle all errors that can occure in our system, and can validate kind of data you input 

Note:
The time is independent, the time serves a timer for you so you can be able to do your task with in the
stated time and will reminder you to switch to the next task

THINGS TO INSTALL:
Modules the user needs to install if they don't already have it/python program 
doesn't support are:
Python-docx and the user has to import it into their file
winsound: Please install winsound if your python program doesn't already have it
Also install colorama either from your terminal: pip install colorama or
use install from project interpretor colorama

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS:
User has to enter their name at the beginining of the program 
before the program starts if not the program won't start. This way we can record whatever
the user is doing on our system.
After the enter their name they will be presented with a menu 
that has add task,remove task, view task, start timer
if the user doesn't add a task the user cannot do anything please add a task first at start

The user is presented with another option asking if they have 
any subtask and if yes user will have to input there sub task 
if no user will be notified that the task they added has been successful 
After adding a task the user can remove the task if they fill it has been 
completed also the program allows users to view their list of task users can also 
start and alarm when they have started the task plus also we used the alarm because we 
want this app to serve as a reminder for users when ever they have set a task and also 
want it to remind them Also the time has to be in accordance with the users laptop time, and
please enter correct time, if your time has already passed then you will see nothing when 
you start timer, and use Current time in yellow color above the menu, it will help you to 
know how you PC count time.
IN TESTING:
Also please note most of our testing method are just repetition because
Most of our classes contains just the init function
Please note we did note test for the doc recording 
we did not test for try and expt
